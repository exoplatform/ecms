*Overview*

The templates are applied to a node type or a metadata mixin type. There are two kinds of templates:

* *dialogs*: are HTML forms that allow to create node instances.
* *views*: are HTML fragments used to display nodes.

From the ECM admin portlet, _Manage Template_ lists existing node types that have been associated to the Dialog and/or View templates. These templates can be attached to permissions (in the usual _membership:group_ form), so that a specific one is displayed according to the rights of the user (very useful in a content validation workflow activity).

*DocumentType*

The checkbox allows specifying if the node type should be considered as a *DocumentType* or not. File Explorer considers such nodes as user content and applies the following behavior:

* *View* template will be used to display the DocumentType nodes.
* *DocumentTypes* nodes can created by the '_Add Document_' action.
* *non DocumentType* nodes are hidden (unless _'Show non document types'_ option is checked).

Templates are written using [Groovy Templates|http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates] and will require some experience with JCR API and HTML notions.
