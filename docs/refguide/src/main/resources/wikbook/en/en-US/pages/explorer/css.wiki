* By using WCM, all the stylesheets of each site can be managed online easily. You do not need to access the file system to modify and wait for the server restarted. About the structure, each site has its own CSS folderw which can contain one or more CSS files. These CSS files have the data, and the priority. If they have the same CSS definition, the bigger priority will be applied. You also can disable some of them to make sure that the disabled style is not applied to the site.

* For example: By default, a WCM demo package has two sites: ACME and Classic. The Classic site has a CSS folder which contains a CSS file called *DefaultStylesheet*. Most of the stylesheets of this site are defined within this stylesheet. Moreover, the ACME site has two CSS files called *BlueStylesheet* and *GreenStylesheet*. The blue one is enabled and the green one is disabled by default. All you need to test is to disable the blue one (by editing it and setting Available equals false) and enable the green one. Now, back to the homepage and you will see the magic.

Remember the cache and refresh the browser first if you do not see any changes. Normally, this is the main reason why the new style is not applied.
